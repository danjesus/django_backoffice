Developed by: **Samuel Sampaio** [@samukasmk](https://github.com/samukasmk)


# Install
This application can be installed on a `classical virtualenv` or on a `docker-compose structure`.

I recommend the installation of `docker-compose structure` because it's very easy and bultin and the app will need for this services:
- **django** (webapp: the host web product in `python`)
- **postgres** (database: to store the app data)
- **celery** (worker: to execute asynchronous tasks)
- **rabbitmq** (message broker: to delivery asynchronous tasks from webapp to worker)
- **nginx** (static files: to serve css, js and image files)

## Installing (by docker-compose)

**Requirements:**
On this mode you will need to have:
- **docker engine** (on your OS): If you need to install (docker engine) [[please read the official documentation]](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
